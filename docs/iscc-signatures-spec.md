# ISCC Signatures

## Introduction

The first edition of ISO 24138:2024 specifies the syntax, structure, and initial algorithms for the
International Standard Content Code (ISCC). An ISCC is a deterministic data descriptor that applies to a
specific digital asset. Anyone can generate an ISCC using the open-source reference implementation or any other
application conforming to the provisions of ISO 24138:2024. However, an ISCC identifies only the digital asset
itself. It makes no assumptions about any associated actors or metadata. Additionally, ISO 24138:2024 does not
define any methods for the interoperable discovery of actors or metadata associated with a digital asset. This
document introduces a protocol designed for scalable, decentralized signing, timestamping, and discovery of
actors and metadata for digital content. It enables a transparent and structured association between ISCCs,
relevant actors, and their corresponding metadata.
