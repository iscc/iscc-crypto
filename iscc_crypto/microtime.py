# Microtime - System-Wide Microsecond Timestamps

This module provides high-precision, monotonic timestamp generation for distributed systems.
It ensures system-wide unique timestamps with microsecond granularity that can be safely
used across threads and independent processes.

## Key Features

- Microsecond (Î¼s) precision timestamps since Unix epoch
- Strictly monotonic (always increasing) sequence guarantee
- Thread-safe and multiprocessing-safe implementation across independent processes
- Both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces
- Upper-bounded by system time (never runs ahead)
- Cross-platform compatible support

## Implementation Details

- Uses shared memory for cross-process synchronization
- Atomic operations ensure thread safety
- Busy-wait with minimal sleep when system clock resolution is exceeded
- Graceful cleanup of shared resources on process exit
- Handles system clock adjustments and jumps

## Warning

This module assumes your system clock is accurate and synchronized. You must separately
ensure proper time synchronization across your infrastructure. Best practices include:

- Use NTP with multiple reliable timeservers
- Configure chrony or similar for precise time sync:
  ```bash
  # /etc/chrony.conf
  pool pool.ntp.org iburst
  makestep 1.0 3    # Step clock if off by >1 sec for first 3 updates
  maxupdateskew 100.0
  ```
- Monitor clock drift and sync status:
  ```bash
  chronyc tracking  # Check sync status
  chronyc sources   # View time sources
  ```

## Performance

The implementation is optimized within the constraints of OS-specific `sleep` resolution.
For details on these constraints see: https://stackoverflow.com/q/1133857/51627

Usage:
    >>> from iscc_crypto.microtime import microtime
    >>> ts = microtime()  # Returns microseconds since epoch as integer
