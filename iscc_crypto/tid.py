"""
ISCC Time-ID

This module provides high-precision, monotonic timestamp generation for distributed systems.
It ensures system-wide unique timestamps with microsecond granularity that can be safely
used across threads and processes.

Key Requirements:
- Microsecond (Î¼s) precision timestamps since Unix epoch
- Strictly monotonic (always increasing) sequence guarantee
- Thread-safe and multiprocessing-safe implementation across independent processes
- Both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces
- Upper-bounded by system time (never runs ahead)
- Cross-platform compatible support
- Minimal CPU usage

Note:
    The implementation is optimized within the constraints of OS-level `sleep` resolution.
    For details on these constraints see:
    https://stackoverflow.com/q/1133857/51627

Usage:
    >>> from iscc_crypto.tid import microtime
    >>> ts = microtime()  # Returns microseconds since epoch as integer
