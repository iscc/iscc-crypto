ISCC Time-ID

This module provides high-precision, monotonic timestamp generation for distributed systems.
It ensures system-wide unique timestamps with microsecond granularity that can be safely
used across threads and processes.

Key features:
- Microsecond (Î¼s) precision timestamps since Unix epoch
- Strictly monotonic (always increasing) sequence guarantee
- Thread-safe and multiprocessing-safe implementation
- Both synchronous and asynchronous interfaces
- Upper-bounded by system time (never runs ahead)
- Cross-platform compatible pure Python implementation
- Minimal CPU usage through adaptive sleep

Warning:
    The current implementation is sufficient for most use cases where processes are spawned
    programmatically from a common parent process, but won't guarantee monotonicity across
    independently started Python processes.

Note:
    The implementation is optimized within the constraints of pure-Python timing
    resolution. For details on these constraints see:
    https://stackoverflow.com/q/1133857/51627

Usage:
    >>> from iscc_crypto.tid import microtime
    >>> ts = microtime()  # Returns microseconds since epoch as integer
