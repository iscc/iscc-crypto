"""
Top Level API for cryptographic operations within the ISCC Framework

This module provides a simple and minimal implementation for timestamping, signing and
verifying JSON data within the ISCC Framework.

Overview:

- We use JSON Web Signatures (JWS) for signing JSON data
- We use JCS for canonical serialization of JSON data
- We use JWS Detached format (no payload) as described by JWS/CT (Clear Text)
- We use the existing reputation of web domains as lightweight roots of trust
- We use simple timestamping protocol

Timestamping:
    A timestamp is a 64-bit hex value where the first 56 bits denote the UTC time in
    Microseconds since unix timestamp epoch and the last 8 bits denote the ID of the
    timestamping server. With 56-bit timestamps a single server can issue up to
    1 Million timestamps per second for up to 2,284 years since epoch. The server-id
    suffix allows for a deployment of up to 256 timestamp servers and ensures that
    timestampes are globaly unique and sortable across timestamping server.

    Clients transmit a blake3 hash of their JCS serialized JSON to a public timestamping
    server and receive a signed UTC timestamp in microseconds.
